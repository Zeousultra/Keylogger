# Keylogger Project (Ethical & Educational Purpose Only)

## Overview
This Python-based keylogger records all keystrokes and logs them in a uniquely named file based on the timestamp of execution. The project is built **for educational and ethical purposes only** and should be used with **explicit permission** from the system owner.

## Features
- **Logs all keystrokes**, including letters, numbers, and special keys (`[ENTER]`, `[SPACE]`, etc.).
- **Timestamps each keystroke** to maintain accurate order.
- **Creates a unique log file per session** (`keylog_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`).
- **Press `ESC` to stop logging**, ensuring an easy exit.
- **Formatted logging** for improved readability.

## Ethical Considerations
ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT:** This keylogger is intended **ONLY** for ethical and educational use. Unauthorized keystroke monitoring is **illegal and unethical**. Always obtain **explicit permission** before using this software.

By using this project, you agree to use it **legally and responsibly**. The creator **is not responsible for any misuse** of this software.
